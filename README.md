# r6 downloader
Hello and welcome to the r6downloader,  
the r6downloader uses the [depotdownloader](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader) project under the hood.  
So basicly it's just a little interface to make it easy for you and us to download older versions of siege.  

## Features
- Easy-to-use interface for downloading older versions of Rainbow Six Siege
- Built on [DepotDownloader](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader)
- Included modding tools for customization
- uses the latest stable cracks from Lungu called: [Throwbackloader](https://github.com/lungu19/ThrowbackLoader/releases/latest)

## How to use
Download the .bat file from releases and put it in your excluded folder. Make sure you are not in Onedrive.  
Run the bat file and it should autodownload everything.  
after you are done downloading go to the new folder downloads > game and press the launchr6.bat file.
